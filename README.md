# Single-cell data analysis for Abdulrahman et al. (2021)

This repository contains a nextflow pipeline that reproduces
the entire single-cell RNA-seq data analysis from our paper.

**The data analysis reports generated by this pipeline are
available here: https://icbi-lab.github.io/abdulrahman2021_paper.**

## How to run

### 1. Acquire the data
<!-- TODO: the data should finally become available (zenodo?) -->
Please follow the data sharing statement in the paper.

Deposit the cellranger files in the `data` directory. The files must follow the following
structure:

```console
data/cellranger/{SAMPLE}_GEX/outs/raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5
```

### 2. Run the pipeline

Prerequisites:
 * [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
 * [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/)

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/icbi-lab/abdulrahman2021_paper.git
```

Start the pipeline:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```

Nextflow will automatically download the required singularity containers 
and run the analysis.

 * The reports will be stored in the `deploy` folder.
 * All (intermediate) results are stored in the `results` folder.
